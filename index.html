                    Welp, this has been a while.. I really need to change a few things.
                    Hopefully this time I won't drop the project after a few days.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                    I'm back!
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I got the chance to start on a new project recently (well 2 months ago, but time flies by).
                    This means that I'm learning a lot every day thanks to an awesome team.
                    </p><p>
                    Working on a project also means that I'll be facing new problems every day, and with a bit of luck I'll
                    be able to write about some of them here on this blog and how I decided to approach them.
                    </p><p>
                    That's also why I'll be writing a bit about API versioning, I'm planning to write a few posts about it
                    and also make a small project to demonstrate the approach in more details.
                </p><p>
                    The first post will be about the URL, this subject has been treated many times and it'll be challenging
                    to bring something new to the table, but I'm gonna try anyway.
                </p><p>
                    The other posts will be about the back-end behind the API versioning while depicting the advantages
                    and disadvantages of different approaches.
                </p><p>

                    Well, that's the plan for now, this should kickstart the project series.
                </p><h3>About this blog...</h3>
                    <p>
                    Now... about this blog, at first I liked the idea of having HTML and stuff, but I'm kinda
                    thinking it's... too much now, I don't like it that much anymore, there's too much bloat, I just
                    want to write. So I'll probably write some small text renderer? Or something similar.
                        I still need to externalise the articles from the index page... this is such a mess atm..
                </p>
                    <p>
                    Not being able to use the tools I usually use is a pain, but that's part of the challenge I guess?
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="article-info row">
                    <div class="col-3">Saturday 05/05/2018</div>
                    <div class="col-9 article-tags">Tags: I'm back blog Pix-I</div>
            </div>
            </div>
            <div class="article">
                <h2 class="article-title">Well.. It seems like I'll be making a blog.</h2>
                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>This is something I've been wanting to do for a really long time now, this blog
                        will be a way for me
                        to share some opinions on some new technologies and projects I'm working on. Let's start with a small
                        Q&A!</p>
                    <h3>Goal</h3>
                    <p>The goal of this blog is to teach you something, and to share some kind of knowledge.</p>
                    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                    <p>I'm a passionate Developer, a few years ago I picked Java as my religion and now I'm trying to learn
                        everything around it. I'm also an avid reader, and I try to read as many books as I can. I firmly believe that
                        reading is one of the best way to gain some new insights. </p>
                    <h3>Why not a CMS?</h3>
                    <p>This blog is hosted on github, why don't I use a CMS? Am I so stingy that I don't want to pay for some wordpress hosting?
                        Well... Not really. I want to be able to write this blog from within my IDE, this IDE is like my home/safe zone and I feel
                        like it's way easier to write here than on some CMS.</p>
                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p>The content on this blog will be divided in <strong>three</strong> types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Projects:</b> Here I'll discuss the projects I'm working on. (Ex. this blog)
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Blog:</b> You'll find mostly short articles about a technology I tried and things I saw or experienced.</li>
                        <li><b>Books:</b> I'm an avid reader and I plan on sharing my thoughts about the books I read.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        I'll try to diversify the content as much as possible. Every content block will also have some notes that I want to share,
                        they may not seem interesting now, but once I think I'll be able to make good use of them once I've made a few blog posts.
                    </p>
                    <h3>This blog is ugly</h3>
                    <p>For now.. <br> But you'll see, this will become pretty pleasing for the eyes. Or not. (I'm not a Front-end dev after all...)</p>
