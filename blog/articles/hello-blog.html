<div class="article">
    <h3 class="article-title">Well.. It seems like I'll be making a blog.</h3>
    <div class="article-content">
        <p>This is something I've been wanting to do for a really long time now, this blog
            will be a way for me
            to share some opinions on some new technologies and projects I'm working on. Let's start with a small
            Q&A!</p>
        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>The goal of this blog is to teach you something, and to share some kind of knowledge.</p>
        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>I'm a passionate Developer, a few years ago I picked Java as my religion and now I'm trying to learn
            everything around it. I'm also an avid reader, and I try to read as many books as I can. I firmly believe that
            reading is one of the best way to gain some new insights. </p>
        <h3>Why not a CMS?</h3>
        <p>This blog is hosted on github, why don't I use a CMS? Am I so stingy that I don't want to pay for some wordpress hosting?
            Well... Not really. I want to be able to write this blog from within my IDE, this IDE is like my home/safe zone and I feel
            like it's way easier to write here than on some CMS.</p>
        <h3>Content</h3>
        <p>The content on this blog will be divided in <strong>three</strong> types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Projects:</b> Here I'll discuss the projects I'm working on. (Ex. this blog)
            </li>
            <li><b>Blog:</b> You'll find mostly short articles about a technology I tried and things I saw or experienced.</li>
            <li><b>Books:</b> I'm an avid reader and I plan on sharing my thoughts about the books I read.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I'll try to diversify the content as much as possible. Every content block will also have some notes that I want to share,
            they may not seem interesting now, but once I think I'll be able to make good use of them once I've made a few blog posts.
        </p>
        <h3>This blog is ugly</h3>
        <p>For now.. <br> But you'll see, this will become pretty pleasing for the eyes. Or not. (I'm not a Front-end dev after all...)</p>
