            Welp, this has been a while.. I really need to change a few things.
            Hopefully this time I won't drop the project after a few days.
        </p>
        <h3>
            I'm back!

        <p>
            I got the chance to start on a new project recently (well 2 months ago, but time flies by).
            This means that I'm learning a lot every day thanks to an awesome team.
        </p><p>
        Working on a project also means that I'll be facing new problems every day, and with a bit of luck I'll
        be able to write about some of them here on this blog and how I decided to approach them.
    </p><p>
        That's also why I'll be writing a bit about API versioning, I'm planning to write a few posts about it
        and also make a small project to demonstrate the approach in more details.
    </p><p>
        The first post will be about the URL, this subject has been treated many times and it'll be challenging
        to bring something new to the table, but I'm gonna try anyway.
    </p><p>
        The other posts will be about the back-end behind the API versioning while depicting the advantages
        and disadvantages of different approaches.
    </p><p>

        Well, that's the plan for now, this should kickstart the project series.
    </p><h3>About this blog...</h3>
        <p>
            Now... about this blog, at first I liked the idea of having HTML and stuff, but I'm kinda
            thinking it's... too much now, I don't like it that much anymore, there's too much bloat, I just
            want to write. So I'll probably write some small text renderer? Or something similar.
            I still need to externalise the articles from the index page... this is such a mess atm..
        </p>
        <p>
            Not being able to use the tools I usually use is a pain, but that's part of the challenge I guess?
