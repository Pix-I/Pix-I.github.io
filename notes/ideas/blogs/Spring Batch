About App
Penguins rule over the world and need to execute some operations on secret documents. (Steal passwords)
 - Database based
Batch window is really small - Concurrency is important


// Story
Some penguins found an unprotected access to a database, the database was used to store unencrypted username/passwords.
The site doesn't have anything interesting on it, but some users re-use their passwords for their online bit coin wallets.

Batch operations needed: (constraints)
 - Test username against 3 different websites.
 - If successful transfer bitcoins
 - Attack can only last a few seconds.
 - To avoid issues you have to wait 5s before trying an username again on a website

Info:
 - There will be 5000 username/passwords
 - Out of them,
   - 100 have an account on ever website with 1 coin
   - 50 have an account on one of the three websites with 3 coins
 - Databases stored on 4 different servers. (Rasperry pis)

//Needed
 - An application that creates and stores data in DB
 - 3 coin application with RestAPI? Or website
 - Spring Batch application

A database that contains non encrypted passwords,
passwords will be dynamically generated

About Spring Batch
Spring Batch is an open source batch framework

made in response to a need of a reusable architecture for batch processing
made by Spring + Accenture

Processing of high volumes of data
Not a scheduler

// Maybe talk about guide lines?
